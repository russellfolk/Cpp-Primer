## Question

> What happens in the program presented in this section if the input values are all equal? What if there are no
> duplicated values?

1. If all inputs are equal the else statement will not be run and the output will be a single instance of "`input`
   occurs `number of times input was supplied` times".

2. If there are no duplicated values in the input then the program will print "`input` occurs 1 times" for each an every
   `input` supplied.
