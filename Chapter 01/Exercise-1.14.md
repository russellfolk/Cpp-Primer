## Question

> Compare and contrast the loops that used a `for` with those using a `while`. Are there advantages or disadvantages to
using either form?

Either loop can be used at either time with some finagling of the arguments. However, in general `for` loops work best
for occasions where the number of iterations is known and `while` loops work best for loops with an unknown number of
iterations at compile time.
