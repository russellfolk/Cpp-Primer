## Question

> Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file naming convention it uses.
> Compile and run the main program from page 2.

## Answer

Primarily using the `LLVM Clang compiler` on macOS Mojave, specifically Apple LLVM version 10.0.0.

As far as naming conventions go, Clang accepts .cpp/.cxx/.cc/.c file extensions for C++ programs, as mentioned in [How
To Setup Clang Tooling For LLVM](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.html?highlight=file%20extension).
